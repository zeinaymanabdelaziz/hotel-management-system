# Hotel Management System

A C++ console-based project simulating a hotel management system.  
Developed for the **Programming II** course, it includes booking, check-in/out, room availability, and payment handling with data persistence using file handling (planned).

# Project Overview

This project allows hotel staff to manage room reservations and guest operations through a command-line interface. It includes:

- Room creation and type assignment (single/double)
- Guest check-in and room booking
- Guest check-out and record deletion
- Summary reporting and payment calculation
- Search functionality by guest name

# Features

- ‚úÖ Check-In system with room type preference
- ‚úÖ Check-Out functionality with status update
- ‚úÖ Display available rooms by type
- ‚úÖ Guest search by name
- ‚úÖ Generate summary reports (bookings, income)
- ‚úÖ Guest-specific payment calculation
- ‚úÖ Delete all records
- üìÅ Data persistence via file handling (optional for future implementation)

# Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Applied**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Structs)
  - Dynamic Memory Allocation
  - File Handling (to be integrated)
  - Control Flow & Data Structures

# How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio):
<br>```bash
<br>g++ HotelSystemProject.cpp -o HotelSystem
<br>./HotelSystem
<br>Follow on-screen menu to:
<br>Check in guests
<br>View available rooms
<br>Search for guests
<br>Make payments
<br>Check out guests
<br>View reports or reset data

# Example Use Cases

<br>A guest wants to book a single room for 3 nights.
<br>Hotel manager wants to know current bookings and total income.
<br>A guest wants to check their room info and make a payment.
<br>The hotel needs to reset all room and guest data.
